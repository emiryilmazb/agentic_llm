# Project Progress

## What Works
- Basic character creation and management
- Character chat functionality (single conversation per character)
- Character prompts and personality definitions
- Chat history storage and retrieval
- Frontend UI for characters and chat

## What's Left to Build
1. **Database Model Changes**:
   - Create new Conversation model 
   - Update Character model to reference conversations instead of containing chat history

2. **Backend API**:
   - Create conversation management endpoints (CRUD operations)
   - Update chat endpoints to work with conversation IDs
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing API consumers

3. **Service Layer Updates**:
   - Create ConversationService
   - Update ChatService to work with conversations
   - Modify CharacterService to remove chat history management

4. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Add conversation selection UI
   - Add "new conversation" button for characters
   - Update chat UI to display conversation context

## Current Status
Planning phase completed. Ready to begin implementation of the Conversation model and related services.

## Known Issues
- Current system only allows one conversation per character
- No ability to name or organize conversations
- Potential data migration challenges for existing chat histories

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial design merged character definition with conversation history for simplicity
- Current task evolves the design to separate these concerns for better flexibility
