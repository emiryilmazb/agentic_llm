# Product Context

## Purpose
The Agentic LLM platform allows users to create, customize, and interact with AI characters. It provides a flexible framework for character-based conversations with large language models.

## Problems Solved
1. **Personalized AI Interactions**: Users can interact with AI characters that have specific personas, knowledge bases, and response styles.
2. **Conversation Management**: The system manages and persists conversations between users and AI characters.
3. **Character Customization**: Users can create and modify AI characters with different personalities and capabilities.

## Current Limitation
Currently, the system appears to tie conversation history directly to characters, meaning a user can only have one ongoing conversation with each character. This limits the ability to have multiple different chat sessions with the same character.

## User Experience Goals
- Users should be able to start new conversations with a character without losing history from previous conversations
- Users should be able to switch between different conversation threads they've had with the same character
- The interface should make it clear which conversation thread is currently active
- Starting a new conversation should be intuitive and straightforward
